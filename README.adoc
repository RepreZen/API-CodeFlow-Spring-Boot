This project serves as a demo for an http://rzen.io/APICodeFlow[API CodeFlow^] approach to API
service implementation. This entails the following three steps,
repeated as the API evolves:

1. **Design** your API in https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification[OpenApi^].
2. **Generate** stub code in Java using the https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot framework^].
3. **Implement** your business logic.

This demo will create a working API to manage a database of live pets for a pet store. The API will
support adding a new pet, updating an existing pet, deleting a pet, listing all pets, and showing
the pet with a given ID.

== Working Through the Demo

=== Overview

The demo proceeds in four phases (plus some initial set-up):


The phases are:

[start=0]
0. Setup - install and launch RepreZen API Studio.

1. **Design** - Create one of the standard OpenAPI v3 example models available in RepreZen API Studio.

2. **Generate** - Use one of the available code generators to generate a new server for the API,
using Spring Boot.

3. **Implement** - Write your business logic into the generated stubs.

4. Repeat (**Design** => **Generate** => **Implement**) in order to add a new method to the API

So let's get going!

=== Phase 0 - Setup

If you don't already have RepreZen API Studio installed, you'll want to visit
https://www.reprezen.com[the RepreZen website^] and sign up for a free trial.
If you're already an Eclipse IDE user, you
may want to consider installing API Studio from Eclipse Marketplace, rather than using the
stand-alone installer offered in the sign-up process. Installation options are explained https://support.reprezen.com/support/solutions/articles/24000009587-reprezen-api-studio-installation-options-desktop-and-eclipse-ide-[here^].

=== Phase 1 - Design

We won't actually design a model here. Instead, we'll just use one of the OpenApi3 models available from the API Studio Examples Wizard.

Follow these steps:

1. Click on the drop-down arrow of the _New_ tool in the toolbar, just under the _File_ menu.

2. Select _RepreZen Examples_ to open the Examples Wizard.
+
image::examples-wizard.png[Open the Examples Wizard]

3. Click on the _OpenAPI v3_ tab.

4. Select the _Expanded Pet Store (v3)_ example, and press _Finish_.
+
image::petstore-example.png[Expanded Pet Store Example]

5. You should see a new project in your workspace, and the example model file itself will automatically open in an editor.

6. Browse through the model briefly to familiarize yourself with its operations and other components.


=== Phase 2 - Generate

We'll make use of one of the built-in API Studio GenTemplates to create our server
implementation. This GenTemplate is one of dozens that are adapted for use in API Studio from the
https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator[OpenAPI Generator^] open-source project.

TIP: We need to use a later version of the OpenAPI Generator library than is packaged with API
Studio at the time of this writing. Steps 6-9 below accomplish this.

Follow these steps:


1. In your model project, locate the `petstore-expanded.yaml` file in the `models` folder, and
double-click on it.

2. Click on the _Create a New GenTarget_ button in the toolbar, just to the left of the _Generate_
button/menu.
+
TIP: If you do not see this in the toolbar, be sure that you are in the **RepreZen** perspective, by
clicking on the appropriate button on the far right of the toolbar: image:reprezen-perspective.png[].
+
image::create-gentarget.png[Create GenTarget]

3. Type "spring" in the resulting dialog's search box, and you should see the **Java Spring
(Boot...)** GenTemplate in the list.

4. Select the **Java Spring** GenTemplate and press _Finish_. A new GenTarget is created in your
project, and the `.gen` file that describes it opens in an editor.
+
image::select-gentemplate.png[]


[start=5]
5. Modify the new `.gen` file (which should be showing now in your active editor) as shown in the
following table. You can copy/paste directly from this table into the `.gen` file.
[none]

  java8: false
```

TIP: This value is a YAML object.  In order to clarify how the value should appear in the .gen file,
we have included the property name with the vaule. That name, `openApiCodegenConfig`, is _not_ part
of the value.

|===

6. Double-click on the model project's `pom.xml` file to open it in an editor.
+
WARNING: Make sure this file is the one at top-level in the model project, not the file of the same
name in the newly created GenTarget folder (or in any other GenTarget folder).

7. Click on the _Dependencies_ tab at the bottom of the editor, then click on the _Add..._ button.
+
image::open-pom-file.png[]

8. Fill out the dialog as shown, then click _OK_. Values (for copy/paste) are:
.. `org.openapitools`
.. `openapi-generator`
.. `3.2.3`
+
image::pom-dependency.png[]

9. Save and close the `pom.xml` editor.

10. Run the generator, by clicking on the big `Generate` button in the toolbar. (Since we've been
actively editing the `.gen` file for the _Java Spring_ GenTarget, the menu should show that as
the generator to run. If not, click instead on the small arrow to the right, and select
_Spring Boot_ from the list of targets.)
+
image::generate-button.png[]

11. The prior step caused a new folder named `implementation` to appear in our model
project. Normally, generated files are placed in a folder named `generated` in the GenTarget folder,
but we changed that by editing the `relativeOutputDir` property in the `.gen` file.
+
We will now turn that `implementation` folder into a Java project in its own right. We can do that
easily because the generator created a Maven `pom.xml` file in the output directory.
+
Right-click on the `implementation` folder and select _Import..._, then select _Maven / Existing
Maven Projects_ in the resulting dialog, and press _Next_.
+
You should see your implementation folder in the _Root
Directory_ field, and the project should appear, already checked, in the _Projects_ list. Click
_Finish_ to create the project.
+
A build of the new project will start immediately, and will probably take several seconds.
+
image::import-maven.png[]

=== Phase 3 - Implement

One of the generated class is an interface named `PetsApiDelegate`, in the
`com.reprezen.demo.springboot.api` package. In the next phase we will create a corresponding
implementation class, containing the business logic for our service.

Follow these steps:

1. Modify the `pom.xml` file so that the project is built using Java 8. This is needed because we
set the `java8` parameter to `false` in the `.gen` file. We did that to prevent generation of
default methods in generated interfaces, but we really do want to build with  Java8.
+
Open the `pom.xml` file in the new `petstore-demo` project, and alter its `java.version` property
value to `1.8`, then save the file.
+
image::pom-java8.png[]

2. Now that we've modified the `pom.xml` file, we need to add it to the `.openapi.generator.ignore`
file, so re-generation will leave our changes in place. The file has a format similar to git's
`.gitignore` file.
+
You probably won't see this file in project explorer, because by default, files with names starting
with a dot are not shown. You can show them by opening the drop-down menu in the project explorer
toolbar and selecting _Filters and Customization..._. Uncheck the *.resources* checkbox, and you
should now see the `.openapi.generator.ignore` file.
+
image::unfilter-dot-files.png[]
+
Once you're able to see the file, open it and add `pom.xml` on a line by itself at the end.
+
TIP: You may want to re-check the *.* resources* filter once you've made this change.

3. We need to update the project so that the pom file changes will take effect. Right-click on the project
name, and select _Maven -> Update Project...`. Press _OK_ in the dialog that appears.
+
image::maven-update.png[]

4. Create our implementation class. Start by right-clicking on the
`com.reprezen.demo.springboot.api` package in the `src/main/java` folder, and select _New ->
Class_. Name the class `PetsApiDelegateImpl`.
+
image::create-class.png[]


5. Replace the text of the class definition with the following:
+
```Java
package com.reprezen.demo.springboot.api;

@Service
public class PetsApiDelegateImpl implements PetsApiDelegate {
 	private final Map<Long, Pet> pets = Maps.newHashMap();
	private long nextId = 0l;
 	@Override
	public ResponseEntity<Pet> addPet(NewPet newPet) {
		Pet petToAdd = new Pet();
		petToAdd.id(nextId++).name(newPet.getName()).tag(newPet.getTag());
		pets.put(petToAdd.getId(), petToAdd);
		return new ResponseEntity<>(petToAdd, HttpStatus.CREATED);
	}
 	@Override
	public ResponseEntity<Void> deletePet(Long id) {
		if (!pets.containsKey(id)) {
			return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
		}
		pets.remove(id);
		return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT);
	}
 	@Override
	public ResponseEntity<Pet> findPetById(Long id) {
		if (!pets.containsKey(id)) {
			return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
		}
		return new ResponseEntity<>(pets.get(id), HttpStatus.ACCEPTED);
	}
 	@Override
	public ResponseEntity<List<Pet>> findPets(List<String> tags, Integer limitObject) {
		int limit = limitObject == null ? Integer.MAX_VALUE : limitObject;
		List<Pet> filteredPets = pets.values().stream()//
				.filter(pet -> (tags == null || tags.isEmpty()) ? true : tags.contains(pet.getTag()))//
				.limit(limit)//
				.collect(Collectors.toList());
		return new ResponseEntity<>(filteredPets, HttpStatus.ACCEPTED);
	}
 }
```
+
TIP: We are using a simple `HashMap` to keep track of our pets. A real-life implementation would
presumably make use of a production database.
+
Don't freak out at all the red error markers! :-)

6. Add missing imports. Right-click in the editor and select _Source -> Organize Imports_.
+
[.thumb]
image::organize-imports.png[]

* Choose `com.google.common.collect.Maps` to resolve the `Maps` type.
* Choose `java.util.List` to resolve the `List` type.
* All other types should be resolved automatically.

+
Save the file once you're finished fixing the imports.


7. Launch the service. Right-click on the `petstore-demo` project, and select _Run As -> Maven
build..._. In the dialog that appears, type `spring-boot:run` in the _Goals_ field, and click
_Run_.
+
[.thumb]
image::run-service.png[]

8. Exercise the service using Swagger-UI, by visiting http://localhost:8080/[^]. If you open the
`pets-api-controller` menu you'll see all the operations defined in the model. Click on any one of
them and click the _Try it out_ button to get an HTML form that you can use to actually send a
request to the running service.
+

image::swagger-ui.png[]

=== Phase 4 - Repeat

Our service does not include any means to update an existing pet, other than deleting and recreating
the pet - an option that will fail to retain the originally assigned pet id.

We can fix this by adding a new PUT method. The operation will expect a pet id value as a path
parameter and the new pet data in the request payload. The effect will be to replace an existing
pet record with that id.

Our approach for this and future API changes is to iterate on the API CodeFlow *Design -> Generate
-> Implement* cycle.

==== Repeat:Design


Open the `petstore-expanded.yaml` file in your model project, and add the new operation
definition to the `/pets/{id}` path item.

You can copy and paste the following into the file immediately after the `/pets/{id}:` line. Be
careful to maintain correct indentation; the method name `put` should be indented two spaces to the
right as compared to the `/pets/{id}` path string. Also, make sure the following `get` operation is
still intact; it's easy for the pasted text to omit a final newline, which will result in `get`
appearing at the end of the last line of the put operation definition - not cool. Break up the line
and correct indentation as needed.

```
    put: 
      description: Update a pet based on the ID
      operationId: updatePet
      requestBody:
        content: 
          "application/json":
            schema:
              $ref: "#/components/schemas/NewPet"
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          description: ID of pet to fetch
          required: true
          schema:
            type: integer
            format: int64
      responses:
        200:
          description: pet response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'
        default:
          description: unexpected error
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Error'

```
==== Repeat:Generate

Here we just re-run the `Spring Boot` GenTarget by pressing the big `Generate` button again.

Updated source files, reflecting the new PUT method, will replace most of the existing files in the
`petstore-demo` project. Our implementation class is not removed, and our customized `pom.xml` file
is not replaced (thanks to our listing it in the `.openapi-codegen-ignore` file).

==== Repeat:Implement

At this point, all looks fine in the GUI, except in fact there is a problem with the `petstore-demo`
project. You can see this by selecting _Project -> Clean..._ in the toolbar, and clicking _Clean_ in
the resulting dialog. This will cause the demo project to be rebuilt, and the result will be an
error marker on the `PetsApiDelegateImpl` class.

This is not surprising, because the interface implemented by that class now declares a method,
`updatePet(Long, NewPet)`, that we never implemented. So of course, we now need to implement that
method.

Open the `PetsApiDelegateImpl` class, and add the following method definition to the class, then
save the file. An automatic rebuild will then clear the error marker.

```Java
@Override
public ResponseEntity<Pet> updatePet(Long id, NewPet newPet) {
	if (!pets.containsKey(id)) {
		return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
	}
	pets.get(id).name(newPet.getName()).tag(newPet.getTag());
	return new ResponseEntity<>(pets.get(id), HttpStatus.ACCEPTED);
}
```

You can now restart the service. Make sure to stop the previous launch first, by clicking on the red
*Terminate* button in the _Console_ view's toolbar. When you reload the Swagger-UI page, you'll find
that your PUT method is now available, along with the others.
